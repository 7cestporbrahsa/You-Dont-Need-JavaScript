## Why You Need the Nexus English Expression Dictionary MP3
 
English is a rich and colorful language that uses many idioms and phrases to express ideas, emotions, opinions, and situations. These expressions are often not literal, but rather figurative or metaphorical. For example, when someone says "it's raining cats and dogs", they don't mean that animals are falling from the sky. They mean that it's raining very heavily.
 
Idioms and phrases are very common in spoken and written English. They make the language more lively, vivid, and expressive. They also show your level of proficiency and familiarity with the culture. However, they can also be very confusing and challenging for learners of English. If you don't know the meaning or usage of an expression, you might misunderstand the speaker or writer, or make a mistake when speaking or writing yourself.
 
That's why you need the Nexus English Expression Dictionary MP3. This dictionary will help you learn and master thousands of idioms and phrases in a fun and easy way.
